<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
We will create and study web apps and their security issues.
</p><p>
We will primarily use Python and Flask for our server-side code.
</p><p>
We will also briefly study other popular back-end languages and libraries, including
node.js
and
Django.
</p>


<hr>


<h2>Your Back-Ends</h2>

<a href="https://pythonanywhere.com">
<p class="parAnchor">
You will create your own publicly-accessible web apps on the site
pythonanywhere.
</p>

<p class="parImp">
USE<br>
YOUR<br>
STUDENT.MTSAC.EDU EMAIL ADDRESS<BR>
TO CREATE YOUR ACCOUNT<BR>
ON PYTHONANYWHERE<BR>
<br>
ADD ME AS YOUR TEACHER
</p>
</a>

<p>
We will also use local private servers.
</p>


<hr>


<h2 id="sec1">Your Front-End</h2>

<p>
Front-ends are necessary for publicly-accessible web apps.
We'll do UIs and APIs.
</p>

<p>
So we will write some HTML,
JavaScript,
XML,
and
JSON.
</p>
  
<p>
We won't waste time with anything more than a basic UI.
That's for another course.
That's why I did not say "CSS".
</p>
  
  
<hr>


<h2>Our Tools</h2>

<p>
I like to use VS Code for my development environment.
I'll use it in the demos.
It's very popular in the wild.
Check out survey results on stackoverflow (CAREFUL!!!)
and other surveys.
</p>
  
<p>
You are free to use whatever development environment you wish.
</p>
  
<p>
We will use github.
</p>

<p>
We will also use client-side Python
and some command-line tools like wget and curl
and other pentesting tools,
and we will use Chrome DevTools.
</p>


<hr>


<h2>Your Background</h2>

<p>
There are no formal prerequisites for this course.
However, this is not a good course for an introduction to computer programming.
</p>

<p>
What should you know?

<h2 id="">My Background</h2>

<p>
I was a Senior Systems Engineer and Network Engineer
in private industry and the military
during a 13-year full-time career,
including years working at AT&T's GNMC (Global Network Management Center)
and Verizon Business's (not Wireless) Enterprise Global WAN Management Services,
troubleshooting and repairing global network infrastructure issues for dozens
of Fortune 500 companies as well as the internal global backbones of those service providers.
</p>

<p>
I studied udergraduate Computer Science
and Mathematics in PhD programs at North Carolina State University,
one of the 3 large research universities in
Research Triangle Park (RTP)
and at UC Riverside.
</p>
  
<p>
I like formal education, lifelong learning,
coding past midnight, debugging, manually editing binaries, swizzling,
using undocument OS APIs, reverse-engineering software and systems,
computer security, reading too much technical material, Star Trek, and Lizard People 
conspiracy theories.
