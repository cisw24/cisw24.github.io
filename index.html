<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p id="intro">
We will create and study web apps and their security issues.
On the back end, we will primarily use Python and Flask,
but we will also briefly study other popular back-end languages and libraries,
like node.js
and Django.
</p>


<hr>


<h2>Your Back-Ends</h2>

<a href="https://pythonanywhere.com" target="_blank">

<p class="parAnchor">
You will create your own publicly-accessible web apps on the site
pythonanywhere.
</p>

<p class="parImp">
USE YOUR STUDENT.MTSAC.EDU EMAIL ADDRESS<BR>
TO CREATE YOUR ACCOUNT<BR>
ON PYTHONANYWHERE<BR>
<br>
ADD ME AS YOUR TEACHER
</p>

</a>

<p>
We will also use local private servers.
</p>


<hr>


<h2 id="sec1">Your Front-End</h2>

<p>
Front-ends are necessary for publicly-accessible web apps,
whether its a UI or an API.
We'll do both, both front-end and back-end code,
and UIs and APIs.
</p>

<p>
So we'll use write some HTML and JavaScript.
We won't waste time with anything more than a basic UI.
That's for another course.
That's why I did not say "CSS".
</p>

<h2>Our Tools</h2>

<p>
I like VS Code for development environment.
I might even love it.
I'll use it in the demos.
It's very popular in the wild.
Check out survey results on stackoverflow (CAREFUL!!!)
and other surveys.
You are free to use whatever development environment you wish.
</p>

<p>
We will also client-side Python
and some command-line tools like wget and curl.
</p>

<h2 id="">Your Background</h2>

<p>
This is not a good course for an introduction to computer programming.
</p>

<p>
There are no formal prerequisites for this course.
But... if you do not have any programming or networking
or server knowledge, then you will need to spend
a "bit of time" studying to understand what's going on.
</p>

<h2 id="">My Background</h2>

<p>
I like learning, formal education, lifelong learning,
coding past midnight, debugging, editing binaries, reverse-engineering software and systems,
computer security, reading too much technical material, Star Trek, and Lizard People 
conspiracy theories.
</p>

<p>
I have professional work experience as a Systems Engineer and Network Engineer
in private industry and the military
during a 13-year full-time career at the senior engineer level,
including years working for AT&T's GNMC (Global Network Management Center)
and Verizon Business's (not Wireless) Enterprise WAN Management Services,
troubleshooting and repairing global network infrastructure issues for dozens
of Fortune 500 companies as well as the internal global backbones of those service providers.
</p>

<p>
My formal education background is a professional student.
I enjoyed being a college and grad school student too much and did it too many years.
I eventually rejoined the real world after leaving a pure math PhD program
to pursue something more practical such as receiving rather than transmitting money
to a higher education institution.
Other concentrations in my formal education also include
Computer Science and Logic (Mathematical and Philosophical).
</p>

<p>
I studied at North Carolina State University,
one of the 3 large research universities in
Research Triangle Park (RTP).
I also studied at UC Riverside.
